# QFake: Generate Fake Geospatial Data
This plugin provides a feature-rich set of tools for generating fake geospatial data according to your specific needs.
Generate vector data such as points, lines, polylines, and polygons; or generate raster data. All with fine-grained
control over:

- minimum/maximum number of features
- spatial extent
- allowing, disallowing, or forcing features to intersect
- minimum/maximum z values
- minimum/maximum local variation
- generation and population of attributes, either at random or using values from a user-supplied table
- and more!

Settings can be saved in a configuration file and loaded when running the plugin; alternatively, leave
any fields blank to use a default value. See the project wiki for more details about usage and configuration.
